<h2>About</h2>

I am a **final-year PhD candidate in Human–Computer Interaction at Ulm University**, focusing on user-centered approaches to sustainability and carbon reduction in resource-intensive digital systems. My current research examines the moral-psychological determinants of rebound effects in pro-environmental technology use, employing a combination of empirical experiments, and statistical, qualitative, and machine learning-based analysis of datasets acquired through data mining. 

I collaborate closely with academic (**UCL Interaction Centre**, **Karlsruhe Institute for Technology**) and industry partners (**Mercedes-Benz Tech Innovation**). My PhD research is supported by the Landesgraduiertenförderung (LGFG) scholarship for PhD Students and the works presented here have been published at international HCI venues such as ACM [**CHI**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/3613904) and in
[**IMWUT**](https://dl.acm.org/journal/imwut).
