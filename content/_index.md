<h2>About</h2>

I am a **final-year PhD candidate in Human–Computer Interaction at Ulm University**, focusing on user-centered sustainability and carbon reduction in resource-intensive digital systems. My research spans (1) designing citizen-facing interactions for emerging urban technologies that go beyond simple automation and (2) analyzing how carbon-reduction mechanisms are implemented in deployed digital systems and what user behaviors they trigger. Methodologically, I combine empirical studies (online, lab, and field), qualitative analysis, statistical methods, and machine learning, including NLP on datasets collected through data mining. 

I collaborate closely with academic (**UCL Interaction Centre**, **Karlsruhe Institute for Technology**) and industry partners (**Mercedes-Benz Tech Innovation**). My PhD research is supported by the Landesgraduiertenförderung (LGFG) scholarship for PhD Students and the works presented here have been published at international HCI venues such as ACM [**CHI**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/3613904) and in
[**IMWUT**](https://dl.acm.org/journal/imwut).
