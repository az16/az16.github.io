Understanding the Effects of External Forces on Spatial Interactions in Moving Vehicles&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/cms/10.1145/3706598.3714077/asset/e187b392-7df9-4257-a872-05c46cab7728/assets/images/large/chi25-985-fig1.jpg&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;As the use of Head-Mounted Displays in moving vehicles increases, passengers can immerse themselves in visual experiences independent of their physical environment. However, interaction methods are susceptible to physical motion, leading to input errors and reduced task performance. This work investigates the impact of G-forces, vibrations, and unpredictable maneuvers on 3D interaction methods. We conducted a field study with 24 participants in both stationary and moving vehicles to examine the effects of vehicle motion on four interaction methods: (1) Gaze&amp;Pinch, (2) DirectTouch, (3) Handray, and (4) HeadGaze. Participants performed selections in a Fitts’ Law task. Our findings reveal a significant effect of vehicle motion on interaction accuracy and duration across the tested combinations of Interaction Method × Road Type × Curve Type. We found a significant impact of movement on throughput, error rate, and perceived workload. Finally, we propose future research considerations and recommendations on interaction methods during vehicle movement.</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;plantpal-leveraging-precision-agriculture-robots-to-facilitate-remote-engagement-in-urban-gardening&#34;&gt;PlantPal: Leveraging Precision Agriculture Robots to Facilitate Remote Engagement in Urban Gardening&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/cms/10.1145/3706598.3713180/asset/530ebcdd-c2ce-4ff0-8d1a-2eedf3b06c75/assets/images/large/chi25-97-fig1.jpg&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;Urban gardening is widely recognized for its numerous health and environmental benefits. However, the lack of suitable garden spaces, demanding daily schedules and limited gardening expertise present major roadblocks for citizens looking to engage in urban gardening. While prior research has explored smart home solutions to support urban gardeners, these approaches currently do not fully address these practical barriers. In this paper, we present PlantPal, a system that enables the cultivation of garden spaces irrespective of one’s location, expertise level, or time constraints. PlantPal enables the shared operation of a precision agriculture robot (PAR) that is equipped with garden tools and a multi-camera system. Insights from a 3-week deployment (N=18) indicate that PlantPal facilitated the integration of gardening tasks into daily routines, fostered a sense of connection with one’s field, and provided an engaging experience despite the remote setting. We contribute design considerations for future robot-assisted urban gardening concepts.</description>

      <title>Exploring Contextual Feature Combinations for Prediction of Subjective Thermal Perceptions</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;exploring-contextual-feature-combinations-for-prediction-of-subjective-thermal-perceptions&#34;&gt;Exploring Contextual Feature Combinations for Prediction of Subjective Thermal Perceptions&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cloudstore.uni-ulm.de/apps/files_sharing/publicpreview/7SyFePiCzcWioqc?file=/&amp;amp;fileId=140650255&amp;amp;x=3024&amp;amp;y=1964&amp;amp;a=true&amp;amp;etag=118823c4c39d8a15f83c1ad1adc54e50&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;Thermal attributes in the environment impact well-being, but their inclusion in standard well-being monitoring is challenging due to complex measurement requirements. Industry standards like the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index need numerous measures and specialized setups, making large-scale applications impractical. This study investigates predicting thermal perception ratings using only contextual factors. We conducted an ablation study using the Chinese Thermal Comfort Dataset (CTCD) and a Random Forest (RF) classifier to evaluate prediction performance with different contextual feature combinations on five labeling scales. Results showed that omitting measures required for PMV index calculation and relying on contextual features exclusively achieved F1 scores similar to those when including PMV measures. Key predictive factors included daily outdoor temperature and a person&#39;s clothing, weight, and age. These findings suggest that leveraging more accessible contextual data to estimate thermal perception ratings is promising, and further research should explore more contextual factors to enhance prediction accuracy and support well-being assessments.</description>

      <title>AutoTherm: A Dataset and Benchmark for Thermal Comfort Estimation Indoors and in Vehicles</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;autotherm-a-dataset-and-benchmark-for-thermal-comfort-estimation-indoors-and-in-vehicles&#34;&gt;AutoTherm: A Dataset and Benchmark for Thermal Comfort Estimation Indoors and in Vehicles&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://viscom.publications.uni-ulm.de/api/uploads/251/teaser%20%283%29.jpg&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;Thermal comfort inside buildings is a well-studied field where human judgment for thermal comfort is collected and may be used for automatic thermal comfort estimation. However, indoor scenarios are rather static in terms of thermal state changes and, thus, cannot be applied to dynamic conditions, e.g., inside a vehicle. In this work, we present our findings of a gap between building and in-vehicle scenarios regarding thermal comfort estimation. We provide evidence by comparing deep neural classifiers for thermal comfort estimation for indoor and in-vehicle conditions. Further, we introduce a temporal dataset for indoor predictions incorporating 31 input signals and self-labeled user ratings by 18 subjects in a self-built climatic chamber. For in-vehicle scenarios, we acquired a second dataset featuring human judgments from 20 subjects in a BMW 3 Series. Our experimental results indicate superior performance for estimations from time series data over single vector input. Leveraging modern machine learning architectures enables us to recognize human thermal comfort states and estimate future states automatically. We provide details on training a recurrent network-based classifier and perform an initial performance benchmark of the proposed dataset. Ultimately, we compare our collected dataset to publicly available thermal comfort datasets.</description>

      <title>&#39;Eco Is Just Marketing&#39;: Unraveling Everyday Barriers to the Adoption of Energy-Saving Features in Major Home Appliances</title>

While prior research focused on increasing the use of ESFs through behavior change interventions, there is currently no clarity on the barriers that restrict their utilization in the first place. To bridge this gap, we conducted a qualitative analysis of 349 Amazon product reviews and 98 Reddit discussions, yielding three qualitative themes that showcase how users perceive, interact with, and evaluate ESFs in HAs. Based on these themes, we derived frequent barriers to ESF adoption, which guided a subsequent expert focus group (N=5) to assess the suitability of behavior change interventions and potential alternative strategies for ESF adoption. Our findings deepen the understanding of everyday barriers surrounding ESFs and enable the targeted design and assessment of interventions for future HAs.</description>
